# state-fair-app

To get started:

1. Dowload this app
1. Run `npm install`
1. Launch the app with `npm start`

To edit this app:

The HTML files are actually (yucky) EJS and stored in `views/`. Note the template used on all pages is called layout.ejs and then the homepage is homepage.ejs. After that it gets pretty self explanitory.

Note: This app uses the latest *beta* version of Sails. If you want to install this version, use:

    npm install -g sails@0.10

If you leave off the `@0.10` you get the latest release version which is 0.9.x. The docs for the beta are at http://beta.sailsjs.org/#/documentation/reference/Assets
